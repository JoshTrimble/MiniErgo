This design was inspired by the Gboards' GergoPlex. I wanted to take the base design and tweak it to be a smaller form factor, while maintaining the layout as much as possible. This board is driven by 2 Xiao Seeed Studio RP2040s and includes hot swappable sockets for Kailh Choc switches. The PCB is designed to be split in half and have the remaining sharp edges sanded down. 

One other thing to note; Because of the minimal footprint achieved, there might be a very slight overhang of the outer hot swap socket solder points and the edge of the board depending on the hot swap sockets used. There should be plenty of room for contact of the PCB tracks to the socket, and the excess can be sanded down to be flush with the PCB. This design might be changed in future versions of the board.
